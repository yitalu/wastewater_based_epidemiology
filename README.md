This project aims to predict COVID-19 confirmed cases by gene copies of virus and other chemical compounds in wastewater. The data was collected in Suffolk County, New York from beginning of 2020 to 2021.

# Analysis Plan

## correlation matrix
(done)

## cross-sectional analysis, no temporal variable
multiple regression or mediation analysis
causal inference

## time series analysis (no theory)
VAR model between 1) confirmed cases and 2) virus or other drug
impulse response function
cointegration and Error Correction Models between 1) virus or confirmed cases and 2) medicine

## Bayesian analysis
Bayesian model between 1) virus and 2) confirmed cases, with epidemiology theory (SIR model)
posterior predictive simulation
